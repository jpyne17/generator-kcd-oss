# generator-pala

Project generator for Pala projects.

---

## The problem

I have to do a lot of repetitive stuff every time I set up a new open source
project.

## This solution

This is a yeoman generator for Pala client projects.

## Inspiration
We used [@kentcdodds][Kent C. Dodds]' [module][generator-ocd-kss] heavily,
the king of JS OSS and tutorials. That in turn [@sindresorhus][sindresorhus]'s
[module][generator-nm].
